# Drone Light Show

This is the final paper for the 20th Annual High School ***Mathematical Contest in Modeling*** (HiMCM), problem A.<br>
I built models to determine the required number of Drones and every Droneâ€™s initial location during the process, and applied mathematical methods to make sure the **setting and flight route** of every drone. **Any simple pictures or icons could be designed for the drone show by my MATLAB program.** Then team describe the flight routes according to mathematical language, and finally wrote a two-page memo to the Mayor to report the results of our investigation and make a recommendation as to whether or not to do the aerial light show.
